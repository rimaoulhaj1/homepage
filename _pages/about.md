I am a Postdoctoral researcher at ISAE-Supméca. I work on causal modeling for fault diagnosis (root-cause analysis) in manufacturing processes with a magnesium foundry use case.

### 🗞️PREPRINT

I am happy to share the preprint of our paper titled "Real Time Power Flow Control in Renewables-Storage Microgrids: Assessing the Reliability Of Finite Horizon Policy Gradient Methods in Constrained and Unconstrained Scenarios" which you can download here : https://lnkd.in/eQVw8tY4

The paper presents the main findings of my PhD with the following highlights :
- ⚒️ The paper introduces a rigorously justified Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework for modeling power flow control in microgrids, supporting systematic benchmarking of deep reinforcement learning methods and providing a clear distinction between feasibility constraints and undesirable actions.
- 💥 The paper compares infinite and finite horizon policy gradient methods, revealing differences in the underlying optimal policies and performance. In the finite horizon case, results from the simultaneous and dynamic algorithms challenge theoretical computational cost predictions in the literature.
- 🗝️ The paper solves a constrained finite-horizon MDP using a primal-dual policy gradient method adapted from an algorithm originally designed for infinite-horizon settings and compares the algorithms intended for the constrained and unconstrained finite horizon problems in terms of algorithmic reliability.
